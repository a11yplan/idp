## For Developers

### Using Team API Methods

```typescript
import { team } from "@/lib/auth-client"

// Create a team
const { data, error } = await team.create({
  name: "Engineering",
  organizationId: "org-id", // optional - defaults to active org
})

// List all teams in organization
const { data: teams } = await team.list({
  query: {
    organizationId: "org-id",
  },
})

// List teams user belongs to
const { data: userTeams } = await team.listUserTeams()

// Update team
await team.update({
  teamId: "team-id",
  data: {
    name: "New Team Name",
  },
})

// Delete team
await team.remove({
  teamId: "team-id",
  organizationId: "org-id", // optional
})

// Set active team
await team.setActive({
  teamId: "team-id", // or null to unset
})

// List team members
const { data: members } = await team.listMembers({
  teamId: "team-id", // optional - defaults to active team
})

// Add member to team
await team.addMember({
  teamId: "team-id",
  userId: "user-id",
})

// Remove member from team
await team.removeMember({
  teamId: "team-id",
  userId: "user-id",
})
```

### Using Team Context

```typescript
import { useTeam } from "@/contexts/team-context"

function MyComponent() {
  const { activeTeam, teams, setActiveTeam, refreshTeams } = useTeam()

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Active Team: {activeTeam?.name || "None"}</h2>

      <select
        value={activeTeam?.id || ""}
        onChange={(e) => {
          const team = teams.find(t => t.id === e.target.value)
          setActiveTeam(team || null)
        }}
      >
        <option value="">No Team</option>
        {teams.map(team => (
          <option key={team.id} value={team.id}>
            {team.name}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>

      <button onClick={refreshTeams}>Refresh Teams</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Using Team Switcher Component

```typescript
import { TeamSwitcher } from "@/components/team/team-switcher"

function Layout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <TeamSwitcher />
      {/* Your content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Configuration

The team feature is configured in `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`:

```typescript
teamConfiguration: {
  enabled: true,
  maximumTeams: 20, // Max teams per organization
  maximumMembersPerTeam: 50, // Max members per team
  allowRemovingAllTeams: false, // Prevent removing the last team
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Teams not showing up?
1. Make sure you're logged in and part of an organization
2. Check that teams are enabled in `auth.ts`
3. Verify database migration ran successfully: `npx @better-auth/cli migrate`

### Can't create teams?
1. Check your user role (must be Owner or Admin)
2. Verify you haven't reached the maximum team limit (20 per organization)
3. Check browser console for any errors

### API returns 404?
1. Ensure Better Auth server is running
2. Check that organization plugin is enabled with teams
3. Verify you're using the correct API endpoint format

## Next Steps

### Integration Ideas
1. **Add TeamProvider to root layout** - Make team context available app-wide
2. **Add TeamSwitcher to navbar** - Quick team switching from anywhere
3. **Filter resources by team** - Show only team-specific data
4. **Team-based permissions** - Implement granular access control
5. **Team analytics** - Track team performance and activity

### Advanced Features
